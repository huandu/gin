h2. What's the gin

The <code>gin</code> is a Game Interactive eNgine. It's designed for HTML5 games on modern browser.

Gin is also a kind of distilled beverage. I've never tried this. It looks pretty good.

h3. Goals

The major goal is to implement most common features required by HTML5 game developers. It will include animation timeline, graphic layers and mouse/gesture/keyboard input implementation.

With this engine, programmers should be able to focus on game logic and graphic effects, just like programming in flash.

I may add hit test and WebGL support in it, but it's not certain at this point.

h3. Non-Goals

It will never include any canvas scene graph api.

h2. Browser Compatability

The <code>gin</code> is tested on
* Chrome 8/10
* Firefox 3.6
