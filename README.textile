h1. About gin

h2. What's the gin

The <code>gin</code> stands for Game Interactive eNgine. It's a gaming engine for HTML5 games.

h3. Goals

The major goal is to implement most common features required by game developers. It will include animation timeline, graphic layers and mouse/gesture/keyboard input emcapsulation.

With this engine, programmers should be able to focus on game logic and graphic effects, just like programming in flash.

I may add hit test and WebGL support in this engine, but it's not certain.

h3. Non-Goals

It will never include any canvas scene graph api.
