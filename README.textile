Welcome to send me feedback in github or "@huandu":http://twitter.com/huandu on twitter.

If you want to play with <code>gin</code> now, see "gin-samples":https://github.com/huandu/gin-samples on github.

h2. What's the gin

The <code>gin</code> is a Game Interactive eNgine. It's designed for HTML5 games on modern browser.

<code>gin</code> is a light-weight engine. Unlike other engines, it doesn't require any OOP knowledge and pre-compile work. It is straight forward.

Gin is also a kind of distilled beverage, but I've never tried it.

h3. Goals

The major goal is to implement most common features required by HTML5 game developers. It will include animation timeline, graphic layers and mouse/gesture/keyboard input support.

With <code>gin</code>, developers should be able to focus on game logic and graphic effects, just like programming in flash. It also implements MovieClip equivalent concept - the layers. Developers can move/resize/render layers independently.

<code>gin</code> caches all keyboard/mouse events. Developers must process these events inside beforerender/render callbacks rather than directly receiving events by adding listerners. It's a different thinking model comparing to other engines. This model will benefit a lot in long term.

I may add hit test and WebGL support in it, but it's not certain at this point.

h3. Non-Goals

It will never include
* Canvas scene graph api
* Physical engine

It's highly recommended to use <code>gin</code> with other mature js frameworks to complete more tasks.

For instance, developers can use "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ to animate layers. It also means, <code>gin</code> will not include any layer animation support.

I don't want to reinvent any wheel. If I'm doing so, please let me know.

h2. Browser Compatability

The <code>gin</code> is tested on
* Chrome 8/10
* Firefox 3.6
