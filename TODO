TODO List for gin
===============================================

Current goal is to make gin workable on mobile device. Long term goal is to implement all Flash equilevant features, including 'movie clip lib' and better animation control.

Current stage:

1. Multi touch and gesture support (iOS and Android)

2. More effective layer design - only render visible layers.
It's very helpful for the 'movie clip lib' in my next step.

Next step:
1. The movie clip lib.
I will implement a animation compiler to generate and parse intermedia animation code. Think of the shader language in WebGL. It should be quite like that.
And I will try to use Wallaby's output directly in gin. However, I don't know whether it's really doable now.

2. Redraw rectangle.
It's not wise to call clearRect() against full canvas. The ideal way is to update necessary part only.

3. The light weight layer
Currently, a layer is a stand alone div with canvas element. Moving a layer is actually moving DOM element. It's too expensive. Light weight layer should be a logic layer sharing canvas with other layer. Moving it is to redraw it on canvas.
